# Highlighter-Selector

<p>I was tired of constantly decide what color highlighter to use next for my school notes.<br>
I couldn't just use a standard random generator because I wanted to remove the color choice one hue before and one after from the list of options, as well as the one just used of course.<br></p>

<p>So I wrote a simple program that now does the job for me.<br>
If nothing else, more practice never hurt anyone.</p>
